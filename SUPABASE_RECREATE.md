Recreating the Supabase/Postgres schema for Monynha-com

What this contains
- SQL migration file: `supabase/migrations/001_recreate_schema.sql` which creates the tables inferred from
  `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` used by the app.
- A convenience loader: `recreate-db.sql` which includes the migration.

How to run locally
1. Ensure you have a Postgres database available (Supabase project or local Postgres).
2. From the repository root, run psql against your DATABASE_URL. Example (PowerShell):

   $env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname";
   psql $env:DATABASE_URL -f recreate-db.sql

Or with Supabase CLI (if configured):

   supabase db remote set <your-db-connection-string>
   supabase db reset --file recreate-db.sql

Assumptions & notes
- The TypeScript types use `string` for `id` fields; this migration uses `text` with a UUID default via
  `uuid_generate_v4()` (requires `uuid-ossp` extension). If your prior DB used `uuid` column type, adjust accordingly.
- Timestamps are created as `timestamptz` columns with `now()` defaults for `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- JSON fields in types are mapped to `jsonb`.
- Unique constraints were added where slugs or keys are expected unique (slug, key, email).
- No FK relationships were present in the types, so none are created here. If you expect relations (e.g. profiles -> auth.users), add them.

Next steps after running
- If you use Supabase typed helpers, regenerate types (if using supabase-js generation tools) or verify that
  `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` matches your DB.
- Import any seed data you need (team members, homepage features, site settings, etc.).

If anything looks off compared to your original DB schema (indexes, constraints, exact column types), share a
SQL export of the original database or tell me what differs and I can adjust the migration.
